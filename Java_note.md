22)The \u0021 article referred to as a
a) Unicode escape sequence
b) Octal escape
c) Hexadecimal
d) Line feed
Answer: (a) Unicode escape sequence
Explanation: In Java, Unicode characters can be used in string literals, comments, and commands, and are expressed by Unicode
Escape Sequences. A Unicode escape sequence is made up of the following articles:
A backslash '\' (ASCII character 92)
A 'u' (ASCII 117)
One or more additional 'u' characters that are optional.
A four hexadecimal digits (a character from 0 - 9 or a-f or A-F)
Hence, the correct answer is the option (a).

23)Which of the following is a valid declaration of a char?
a) char ch = '\utea';
b) char ca = 'tea';
c) char cr = \u0223;
d) char cc = '\itea';
Answer: (a) char ch = '\utea';
A char literal may contain a Unicode character (UTF-16). We can directly use these characters only if our file system allows us,
else use a Unicode escape (\u) such as "\u02tee". The char literals are always declared in single quotes (').
The option b, c, and d, are not valid because:
In the option b), to make a String valid char literal, we should add prefix "\u" in the string.
In the option c), single quotes are not present.
In the option d), "\i" is used in place of "\u."
Hence, the correct answer is the option (a).

24)Which of the following tool is used to generate API documentation in HTML format from doc comments in source code?
a) javap tool
b) javaw command
c) Javadoc tool
d) javah command

d-enum.
e-annotation.
f-package.
g-Variable.
h-Method.
i-Constructor.
j-Block.
38)why class is essential ?
Ans-> class is essential because java is an object oriented programming language ,every program must start with a class and
moreover only class allows us to define method with logic.

39)What is main method ?
Ans-> Main method is user-defined method with pre-defined prototype.

40)Why main method ?
Ans-> main method is essential because java program execution starts with main method jvm can execute only main method from a class.

41)what is the syntax of main method ?
Ans-> public static void main(String args[]){}

42)why main method has public ?
Ans-> To be accessed by JVM software from outside of our project directory min method must has public keyword .

43)why main method has static ?
Ans-> To access and execute main method logic without creating object ,main method has static keyword.

44)Why main method return type is void ?
Ans-> Returning value from the main method is useless because the value returning from jvm main method will be return to jvm ,Jvm
will not do any work with this returned value ,hence to stop returning value from main method it must be void .

45)Why main method name is main ?
Ans-> According to coding standards main method name is choosen as main because it is the initial point of class execution ,
any initial poiint generally called as main .

46. Why main method has parameter ?
    Ans-> The main method has parameter to receive input values from enduser at the time of program execution from command line.

47. Why main method parameter is Array?
    Ans-> To allow end-user to pass multiple value ?

48. why main method parameter type is String[] ?
    Ans-> Any value sending from keyboard will passed into program as string type by us,and moreover only values can be represented
    in terms of string and further it can be converted to its original type,hence SUN choosen main method parameter type as
    String[].

49)Why main method parameter name is args ?
Ans-> The input values sending to a method parameter is technically called as arguement ,so it is the short -cut name of arguement.

50)Can we change the parts of main method ?
Ans-> Except args we are not allowed to change or remove the main method other parts.

51)Why System.out.println() is essential ?
Ans-> System.out.println() is essential because in java we can print any message or data on console by this statement.

52. What are the java printing statements ?
    Ans-> java has 3 printing statements to display
    a. System.out.println();
    b. System.out.print();
    c. System.out.printf();
    53)what is user defined method ?
    Ans-> Developer defined method is called user -defined method.

54)What is pre-defined method ?
Ans-> This methods may be developed by suns developer or some other developer is called pre-defined method.
55)where will we use java?

we will use java. For Example : Amazon,Flipcart ,bank app .

      For Python:for developing data science ,mechine learning ,AI application python is used for developing recomendations
                 based user search data we must use python.
      For c:We use c for developing system level and application level software which are stand alone and platform dependent
               ex. os,Drivers and ms office etc.

57)what is platform dependent application?
Ans-> The programming language that is compiled in one os and it cannot run in another operating system then application is
called platform dependent application.

58)What is platform independent application?
Ans-> If the compiled code is able to run in different appllication is called platform-independent application.
The programming language that is used to develope this application is called platform-independent programming language.
Example: java
59)What is stand alone application and types ?
Ans-> The application that can only be executed in local call , is called stand-alone application.
it means a program that can be accessible only one computer in which it is installed by single user .Stand alone applications
cannot accessible form remote user via internet.
types 1. CUI 2. GUI
60)What is internet application and it's type ?
Ans-> Internet application is a multiple computers and multiple user appllication .it means a program i.e. accessible locally and remotely
from different computers through the network call by multiple users at a time is called internet application.
it is of two types :-
a.Client-side executing applications
b.server-side executing applications

61)what is the main features of programming language to develope internet application?
Ans-> Platform independency because an internet application must run in all operating systems irrespective of where it is compiled.

62)Why c and c++ programming language can not support internet application development?
Ans-> Because they are platform dependent .

63)why c and c++ programming language were developed as platform dependent application why not as platform independent application?
Ans-> By the times c/c++ programming languages are developed there was no internet ,platform independency features is
only required for developing internet applications.
64)why c/c++ program compiled code can not execute in all os?
Ans-> in these programming languages the compiled code is machine language which is understandable only by the current os.Thus the
compiled code cannot be executed in different operating system.Due to this reason these languages are considered as platform dependent
programming languages.

65)what is the need of proramming language ?

Every programming language is meant for developing a program to implement an operation to be perform by a computer .
Basically programming language are inverted for automatic bussiness operations to be performed by a computer.
Automation will give several benefits over manual operations they are,
a.24\*7 ,365 days we run ourcbussiness.
b.we can have good relation with customer.
c.Secured ,accurated,efficient fast transaction .

66. what are the language fundamentals ?
    1.Data type (literal ,variables and object )-Storing values.
    2.Operators-for performing validation & calculation .
    3.Control flow Statement- for controling flow of execution .
    4.Exception handling Statements-for throwing and catching and exception.
    The above 4 concepts are technically called as language fundamentals.
